        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><strong>NOTE: Make sure to have your beef seasoned and your toppings ready to apply before proceeding</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast your bun - <strong>(Having your bun perfectly toasted is super imporant)</strong></li>
            
            <li>Apply the Wagyu Beef to a pan warmed up to medium high and cook one side until a good sear is visible </li>
            <li>Once sear is visible turn off heat competely and flip patty</li>
            <li>Apply cheese to patty and cover with pan lid to melt cheese and let patty rest</li>
            <li>While allowing the cheese to melt add spicy mayo and yum yum sauce to the toasted bun</li>
            <li>Add shredded lettuce to the bottom bun <strong>(putting it on the top bun you risk everything falling out when you top your burger)</strong></li>
            <li>Add onions to bottom bun as well</li>
            <li>Now that the cheese is melted and your patty is rested add the patty to the bottom bun</li>
            <li>If you prefer to add more lettuce now is the time to add on top of the cheese so that it will hold to the cheese</li>
            <li>Finally it's time to top your burger - <strong>You've just made the World Famous Paul Smash Burger!</strong></li>
        </ol>
